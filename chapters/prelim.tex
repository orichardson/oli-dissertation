In this chapter, we build up a library of standard mathematical concepts and notation needed to fully understand them.

    % the way we get there is perhaps unusual. 
the way it all fits together may not be as familiar. 
The notation is carefully selected to be extremely precise,

\section{Basic Concepts and Foundational Notation}

% Only \cref{sec:}
Let's start with the basics.
There are two kinds of equalities: definitions, and assertions. 
We distinguish between the two.
Namely, we write ``$A := B$'' when we want to (re)defines the symbol $A$ so stand for $B$,
but write ``$A = B$'' to assert that the (already defined) expressions $A$ and $B$ stand for the same object.

% \paragraph{Basic Concepts and Notation.}
\paragraph{Sets, Maps, Numbers, and Logic.}
A \emph{set} is a collection of unique elements, 
    such as 
    $\{1, \texttt{hello}, 7\}$,
    the empty set $\emptyset$, 
    the natural numbers $\mathbb N = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots \}$,
    or the set $\mathbb R$ of real numbers. 
A \emph{singleton} is a set with precisely one element. 
We write $a \in A$, or $a : A$, 
    to indicate that $a$ is an element of the set $A$
    (and $a \notin A$ to indicate otherwise).
For brevity, we write $a,b \in A$ to indicate that both $a \in A$ and $b \in A$. 
$A$ is a \emph{subset} of $B$ (written $A \subseteq B$) means that every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$, and $2^A$ is the set of all subsets of $A$.
% We write $\Set$ for the collection of all sets (which is not itself a set). 

There are a number of important ways to combine two sets $A$ and $B$ to produce a third set.  
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item 
% \end{enumerate}
Their \emph{union}, denoted $A \cup B$, is the set of all elements contained in either $A$ or $B$ (or both),
while their \emph{intersection} $A \cap B := \{x \in A : x \in B\}$ is the set of elements they have in common.
The \emph{product} of $A$ and $B$ is the set $A \times B := \{ (a,b) : a \in A \land b \in B\}$. 
The \emph{disjoint union} of $A$ and $B$ is a variant of a union in which all elements are forced to be distinct, by ``tagging'' them with the set they come from, i.e., 
% \[
$
    A \sqcup B := \{ (A, a) : a \in A \} \cup \{ (B, b) : b \in B \}. 
$
% \]

We write $|A|$ or $\# A$ for the \emph{cardinality} of a set $A$;
    typically when we write this,  $A$ will be \emph{finite}, 
    meaning it contains $|A| \in \mathbb N$ distinct elements. 
When $n \in \mathbb N$ is a natural number, let
    $[n] := \{ 0, 1, \ldots, n-1 \}$ denote the set of the first $n$ natural numbers.
When $a$ and $b$ are numbers (e.g., elements of $\mathbb N$ or $\mathbb R$), we denote their product by $a \cdot b$, or, more commonly, simply $a b$.
We will also often consider extended numbers that include positive infinity ($\infty$), and perform arithmetic with it by defining, for $r \in \mathbb R$,
\[
    \infty + r := \infty,
    \qquad 
    \infty \cdot r := \infty \text{ for }r > 0,
    \qquad
    \infty \cdot 0 := 0,
    % \quad \text{and } \infty + $
\]
and leaving $\infty \cdot r$ undefined when $r < 0$. 
We write $\Rext := \mathbb R \cup \{\infty\}$ for the set of extended real numbers, and $[0, \infty]$ for just the non-negative ones. 


We write $\forall x \in X.~\varphi(x)$ to indicate that a logical expression $\varphi(x)$ is true \emph{for all} $x \in X$, and $\exists x \in X.~ \varphi(x)$ to indicate that there \emph{exists some} $x \in X$ such that $\varphi(x)$ is true.
We use both of the two standard ``set-builder'' notations 
$\{ x \in X ~|~ \varphi(x) \}$ 
    and
    $\{ x \in X : \varphi(x) \}$ 
    to construct the subset of $X$ that satisfies the property $\varphi$;
    the choice between the colon and the bar is made to enhance readability in context.
We write $\lnot\varphi$ for the negation of an expression $\varphi$. 
If $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are both logical expressions, we write $\varphi \land \psi$ for their conjunction (which is true only if $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are both true), and $\varphi \lor \psi$ for their disjunction (which is true if and only if either $\varphi$ or $\psi$ are true).
In some contexts, it is standard (and may feel more natural) to use a comma instead of ``$\land$'' to conjoin logical expressions. 
The notation $\varphi \implies \psi$ means that $\psi$ holds whenever $\phi$ does, and can be viewed as an abbreviation for $\lnot \varphi \lor \psi$, 
and $\varphi \iff \psi$ to indicate that the two are logically equivalent (which can be viewed as an abbreviation for $(\varphi \implies \psi) \land (\psi \implies \varphi)$).
Speaking of logical equivalence, we often abbreviate ``if and only if'' by writing just ``iff''. 

% Given two sets $A$ and $B$, there are a number of ways t 
% The \emph{product }
% The \emph{union} $A \cup B := \{ x : x \in B \}$  


A \emph{map}, or \emph{function} $f : A \to B$ is an object that, 
    given $a \in \Ar$, produces a value $f(a) \in B$. 
If $f, g : A \to B$ have the same behavior (i.e., $\forall a\in A.~f(a) = f(a)$),
    then they are considered equal, and we write $f = g$. 
Thus, a function can be specified with the notation $f = a \mapsto f(a)$,
    which allows us to talk about functions without naming them.
% The \emph{image} of a subset $U \subseteq A$ is the set $\im(f) := \{ f(b) : a \in A\} \subseteq B$ of possible results from applying $f$; meanwhile,
The \emph{preimage} of a set $V \subseteq B$ is the set 
$f^{-1}(V) := \{a \in A : f(a) \in V \} \subseteq A$ of inputs to $f$, whose corresponding outputs are in $V$.
We can \emph{compose} the functions $f : A \to B$ and $g : B \to C$
to form a new function $g \circ f : A \to C$, defined by $(g \circ f) := a \mapsto g(f(a))$. 
% We also regularly make use of the \emph{indicator function}
When $A \subseteq X$, it is often very useful to refer to the \emph{indicator function} for membership in $A$,
\[
\mathbbm1[A]  := x \mapsto {\singlespacing\begin{cases}
    1 & \text{ if } x \in A \\
    0 & \text { if } x \notin A
\end{cases}}
\quad: X \to \{0,1\}
\]

As one might hope from the notation, ``$A \to B$''
    is the set of functions from $A$ to $B$; it is also written $B^A$. 
It is worth pausing here to reflect on some implications of this notation.
First, if $1 = \{ \star \}$ is a singleton set, then an element $a \in A$ is really no different from a map $a \in A^1 = 1 \to A$. 
Second, if $2 = \{ 0, 1\}$ represents a set with 2 elements, then 
    the elements of $2^A$ are functions assigning either $0$ (absence) or $1$ (presence) to each element of $A$---that is, they are subsets of $A$. 
Finally, $|A^B| = |A|^{|B|}$. 


% \paragraph{Indexed sets, Tuples, and Sequeces.}
If $I$ is a set, then an \emph{indexed set}
    $\mat a = \{ a_i \}_{i \in I}$ consists of a collection of objects, one for each $a_i$. 
If $\forall i.~a_i \in A$, then $\mat a$ is just a function $\mat a : I \to A$. 
% The set of indexed 
% Therefore, if each $a_i \in A_i$, then  $\mat a : \sqcup_{i \in I} A_i  
A \emph{tuple} is the special case of a set indexed by $[n]$ for some natural number $n \in \mathbb N$, and typically written with parentheses in order, as in $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$.
A \emph{sequence} is the special case of a set indexed by $\mathbb N$, and is typically also written with parentheses, as in $(a_1, a_2, \ldots)$.

\paragraph{Linear Algebra.}
For us, a \emph{vector} is a map from a finite set $I$, called its 
\emph{shape}, to the (possibly extended) reals.
To simplify and match standard notation, we write $\mathbb R^n$ instead of $\mathbb R^{[n]}$, and often write $\mat u = [u_i]_{i \in I}$ to specify a vector $\mat u$ by its components.
% Note that $
Given a number $\alpha \in \mathbb R$ and a vector $\mat u \in \Rext^I$,
    we can form the scaled vector 
    $\alpha \mat u := [ \alpha  u_i ]_{i \in I} = i \mapsto \mat \alpha \cdot \mat u(i)$
    % (unless some $u_i$ is infinite and $\alpha < 0$)
    \unskip;
    for this reason, $\alpha$ is called a \emph{scalar} in this context. 
Vectors of the same shape
% Suppose that $\mat u, \mat v \in \Rext^S$ are two vectors of 
can be added ($+$) or multiplied ($\odot$) pointwise as usual,
    and we say that $\mat u \le \mat v$ iff $\mat u(i) \le \mat v(i)$ for all $i \in I$.
$\mat 1$ denotes an all-ones vector, of a shape implied by context.
If $\mat u$ and $\mat v$ are both of shape $I$, their \emph{inner product}, denoted either $\mat u \cdot \mat v$ or $\mat u ^{\sf T} \mat v$,
    is the real number $\sum_{i \in I} \mat u(i) \mat v(i)$. 
The latter notation will become clear once we introduce the notion of a \emph{matrix}. 

A map $f : \mathbb R^I \to \mathbb R^J$ is \emph{linear} iff
$f( \alpha \mat u + \beta \mat v) = \alpha f(\mat u) + \beta f(\mat v)$ for all $\mat u, \mat v \in \mathbb R^I$. 
There is a natural
1-1 correspondence between linear maps $f : \mathbb R^I \to \mathbb R^J$ and
special vectors $A \in \mathbb R^{J \times I}$ called \emph{matrices}---%
    a fact that is arguably the foundation of linear algebra.
% Specifically, the matrix $A = [a_{i,j}]_{(i,j) \in I\times J} \in \mathbb R^{I \times J}$ represents the function $[u_j]_{j \in J} \mapsto [ \sum_{j \in J} u_j a_{j,i} ]_{i \in I}$.
Specifically, the matrix $A \in \mathbb R^{J\times I}$ represents the function $\mat u \mapsto [ \sum_{j \in J} \mat u(j) A({j,i}) ]_{i \in I}$.
%
Two matrices $A \in \mathbb R^{I \times J}$ and $B \in \mathbb R^{J \times K}$
can be multiplied to form a matrix
% \[
$\displaystyle
    A B = \Big[ \sum_{j \in J} a_{i,j} \cdot b_{j,k} \Big]_{(i,k) \in I \times K}~;
$
% \]
remarkably, if $f_A : \mathbb R^{J} \to \mathbb R^{I}$ and $f_B : \mathbb R^{K} \to \mathbb R^J$ are the linear maps corresponding to $A$ and $B$, respectively, then
$A B$ is the matrix corresponding to $f_A \circ f_B$. 
Observe that a vector $\mu \in \mathbb R^I$ can be seamlessly viewed as
    a matrix $\mat u \in \mathbb R^{I \times 1}$ for the purposes of composition; in this form, they it is called a \emph{column vector}.
This establishes that linear maps can be viewed as vectors, 
    and vectors can be viewed as linear maps.
% This is yet another instance
The result is another 
% This illustrates a general guiding principle in this thesis: 
%     the nouns (here, the vectors), but rather the maps between sets. 

% For this reason, 
% A \emph{matrix} is a function $A \in \mathbb R^{S \times T}$

\textbf{Cones and Convexity.}
A subset $A \subseteq \Rext^I$ of extended real space is a \emph{convex set} iff
it contains all of the line segments between pairs of its elements---that is, if
it has the property that
$
(1-\lambda) \mat u + \lambda \mat v \in A
$
% it is close
for all $\mat u, \mat v \in A$ and $\lambda \in [0,1]$,
$(1-\lambda)$.
% Convex sets have some important relationships with probability distributions.
The probability simplex $\Delta \Omega$ is the prototypical convex set. 
The \emph{convex hull} of a subset of $U \subseteq \Rext^I$ is the smallest convex set that contains $U$. 
The \emph{extreme points} or \emph{vertices} of a convex set $A$ is the smallest subset 
% $\matrm{Ext}(A) 
of $A$ whose convex hull is $A$. 
% For instance, $\mathrm{Ext}(\Delta \Omega) = \{ \delta_{\omega} : \omega \in \Omega \}$. 
% If $A$ is a convex set with $|\mathrm{Ext}(A)| \in \mathbb N$,
% then $A$ is the image of a linear map ....
For instance, the convex hull of $\{ (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) \}$
is the unit square $[0,1]^2$, and the extreme points of the unit square are those four points. 

%
A funtion $f : \Rext^I \to \Rext$ is \emph{convex} iff
\[
    \forall \mat u, \mat v \in \Rext^I,~\forall \lambda \in (0,1).\quad
    f( (1-\lambda) \mat u + \lambda \mat v ) \le (1-\lambda) f(\mat u) + \lambda f(\mat v).
\]
Recall that a linear map is one for which this relationship always holds with equality for all $\mat u$ and $\mat v$. 
A \emph{strictly convex} function, on the other hand, is one where it never does, except when $\mat u = \mat v$. 

% The two notions are closely related: a c 
Convex functions and convex sets are closely related. The set of points that lie above a function $f$
 (its so-called \emph{epigraph} $\{ (\mat u, f(\mat u)) : \mat u \in \Rext^I$) 
is a convex set if and only if $f$ is convex. The level sets of a function $f$ (i.e., $\{ \mat u \in \Rext^I : f(\mat u) \le k \}$ for some $k \in \Rext$) are convex if $f$ is convex. And $\mat u \mapsto \infty \mathbbm 1[\mat u \in A]$ is a convex function iff $A$ is a convex set. 

% A \emph{conic combination} is a linear combination 
A \emph{cone} is something between a linear space and a convex set: a linear space is one closed under linear combination with arbitrary coefficients, while a cone is one closed under linear combination with non-negative coefficients, and a convex space is closed under linear combination with non-negative coefficients that sum to one.
It follows that linear spaces are cones, and cones are convex.

\subsection{Variables}
    \label{ssec:basic-vars}
% A less standard concept, but one on which this thesis revolves is that of a \emph{variable}.
% A less standard concept, but one on which this thesis revolves is that of a \emph{variable}.
% Another standard concept, but one 
We now turn to the concept of a \emph{variable}.
Intuitively, a variable represents some feature of the world or some property of some object. 
Although variables are widely used across computer science---in programming languages, graphical models, causality, and probability theory, to name a few---there are actually several different closely related formalisms. 
We give a (perhaps somewhat opinionated) account here that simultaneously explicates many of approaches in the literature. 

% Our presentation of it is not standard, but largely because it incorprorates standard 
Mathematically, our notion of a variable exists on two levels.
\emph{Qualitatively}, a variable is just some unique identifier (the variable name), such as ``Height'', or $X$. 
We typically use capital roman letters for variables.
\emph{Quantitatively}, a variable $X$ is also associated with a set $\V(X)$, or simply $\V\!X$, of possible values. 
For example, $\V(\text{Height})$ might be the set of positive real numbers, 
    or the set $\{ \texttt{short}, \texttt{tall} \}$. 
A \emph{binary variable} is one whose possible values are $\{0, 1\}$, and a 
    \emph{real variable} is one whose possible values are $\mathbb R$. 
A \emph{constant} is a variable $X$ that can only take on one possible value (i.e., $|\V\! X| = 1$).

\paragraph{Joint Variables.}
We can regard sets of variables $\mat X$ as variables themselves, with
$\V \mat X = \Pi_{X \in \mat X} \V\! X$.
However, when we do so, we must also be careful to remember $\mat X$ the variable has a special relationship with $\mat X$, the set of variables, a point we will soon return to. 
Note that, by this definition, the empty set is a variable, and it takes on a single value (i.e., the unique setting of no variables).  
This might seem strange, but there is precisely one way of selecting a value for each variable in $\varnothing$: simply do nothing. 
To see this another way, observe that if $\mat X = \{ X_1, \ldots, X_n \}$ is a set of binary variables,
then $|\V\mat X| = 2^n$, so in the special case of $n=0$, we have $|\V \varnothing | = 2^0 = 1$. 
Those with keen attention to typography may have noticed we have used a different symbol ($\varnothing$) for the empty set of variables, than we have for other empty sets $(\emptyset)$. 
This will be necessary to avoid a minor ambiguity, because the (standard) notation for probability that we adopt has a different meaning applied to a set of variables than it does applied to a set of possible outcomes. 

Similarly, tuples $(X_1, \ldots, X_n)$ of variables and indexed sets $\{X_i\}_{i \in I}$ of variables, are also themselves variables,
with
\begin{align*}
    \V(X_1, \ldots, X_n) &= \{ (x_1, \ldots, x_n) : \forall i \in [n].~~ x_i \in \V(X_i) \},
\end{align*}
 % \text{and}\quad
% More generally, 
and, more generally,
$
    \V\{ X_i \}_{i \in I} := \prod_{i \in I} \V(X_i).
$
% \end{align*}
The distinction between sets and indexed sets (such as tuples) of variables is only relevant when variables are not unique---a caveat that is far more relevant for the python implementation of this framework than it is for the mathematical development.
% Consequently, we convert between the two 
In the text here, we convert between the two equivalent representations as is convenient, often implicitly converting a set of variables to a tuple of variables with a specific ordering for the purposes of presentation.
% Later on, we will blur the line between sets and indexed sets,

Given a joint setting $\mat x \in \V(\mat X)$, we write either $\mat x[X]$ or  $X(\mat x)$ for the value of the variable $X$ in the joint setting $\mat x$. The former is familiar lookup notation from many programming languages, and the latter is random variable notation, which we will get to in the next section.

% Equality of variables 
\paragraph{Variable Equality, Truth, and Functions of Variables.}
Variable notation is designed to look intuitive. Yet beneath the surface, it can be very confusing, as it is quite unlike the standard mathematical notation for every other mathematical object.
This is especially true of the way variables interact with equality, and the symbol ``$=$''.
For instance, if $X$ is a variable and $x \in \V(X)$, then the notation $X{=}x$ does not necessarily stand for a false statement (even though $X$ and $x$ refer to different mathematical objects); instead, it represents the possibility that $X$ happens take on the value $x$, which we will soon see is called an \emph{event} in the context of probability. 
% In particular, it is neither true nor false, but rather a different mathematical object. 
% Worse, even if $X$ and $Y$ are both variables, then $X{=}Y$ intuitively represents the possibility that $X$ happens to equal $Y$, 
Even if $X$ and $Y$ are both variables, one might expect $X{=}Y$ to be true if and only if $X$ and $Y$ stand for the same variable, but here again it instead typically represents the possibility that $X$ and $Y$ happen to equal the same thing. 

By taking context into account, there is a nice way to rigorously remove this ambiguity, and also have all of our notation work out as we would hope. 
% If $f(\X)$
But before we resolve the issue, we must first explain a more general version of it. 
Whenever $X$ is a variable, and $f : \V\!X \to S$ is a function of the value of $X$, then we can regard $f(X)$ itself as a variable, with $\V(f(X)) = S$. 
The issue with equality we encountered in the previous paragraph is just the special case when we view ${=} : \V(X,Y) \to \{0,1\}$ as such a function. 
% However, when we do so, we must keep in mind that $f(X)$ and $X$ are related.
%
% The key is to keep in mind
However, when we do so we must also keep in mind that the variable $f(X)$ and the variable $X$ cannot simply take any values; they are related by the constraint $f$. 
An analogous constraint appears when we regard an (indexed) set of variables as a variable.
The solution, requires us to keep track constraints involved in the construction of the relevant variables; 
% for a (set of) variables $\X$, call this set of constraints $\Gamma(\X)$. 
if $X$ is a variable, let $\Gamma(X)$ denote this set of constraints. 
% if $X$ is a variable for a (set of) variables $\X$, call this set of constraints $\Gamma(\X)$. 
%
Now, when we write $X = Y$ we primarily mean the possibility that $X$ and $Y$ take the same value, which is a rich mathematical object (e.g., an event, or itself a variable). 
But at the same time, we can also implicitly convert that object to a truth value, in contexts where a truth value is appropriate.
Specifically, 
if the construction of $X$ involves constraints on the set of variables $\mat X$, and the construction of $Y$ involves constraints on the variables $\mat Y$, 
then we say $X{=}Y$ is \emph{true} iff $w[X] = w[Y]$ for all $w \in \V(\mat X \cup \mat Y)$ that satisfy the constraints of $\Gamma(X)$ and $\Gamma(Y)$.
A variable $X$ \emph{primitive} if $\Gamma(X)$ is empty, and we typically use the symbol $\X$ to denote the set of all primitive variables relevant to the current context.

The approach described above gives us what we want in essentially every context. 
It is always true that $X = X$, but not in general true that $X = X'$ unless $X$ and $X'$ must be equal by construction, or if $X$ and $X'$ are constants representing the same value. 
It is true that $f(X) = g(X)$ if and only if $f = g$.
If $X$ and $Y$ are real variables, then (it is true that) $X + Y = Y + X$.
At the same time, these expressions remain unambiguously meaningful for describing events (as we will soon see). And when expressions are \emph{true}, they are events that must necessarily occur.


% Clearly the full implications of this setup of variables can get rather tangled up
Most formalisms that involve variables avoid these issues by adopting only fragments of this picture, or sweeping ambiguities under the rug.
But it isn't necessary to do so; all of these standard concepts can coexist in one perfectly formal context.
The constraint-tracking resolution resolution to these issues gives just a taste of a broader approach to modeling, which lies at the heart of the theory of probabilistic dependency graphs. 
% gives a taste of the approach at the heart of the PDG formalism,   
% and how we can have our cake and eat it too. 
% Yet it turns out that all of this can be made precise with probabilistic dependency graphs, the mathematical representation of uncertainty that lies at the heart of this dissertation.  
The missing part, as one might expect, is the probability. 

\section{Probability, and Other Representations of Uncertainty}

% The material and notation in this chapter is all standard, but 
% The one we have chosen 
There are many different notations for probability in different community.
% In this section, we present a carefully 
Our approach simultaneously enables some of the most common notations
    and the most recognizable foundations. 
Thus, although all of the pieces are likely to be familiar, the precise formal way it fits together may not be. 
%
We start by giving the simpler picture of probability in the finite case (\cref{ssec:fin-prob}), which, for our purposes, is largely representative of how one should think of probability in the general case (which we return to \cref{ssec:gen-prob}).

\subsection{Probability, in the Finite Case}
    \label{ssec:fin-prob}
% We first give the simple picture of probability in which representations are finite. 
% in the finite case; for now, assume the variables $X$ and $Y$ can take on only finitely many possible
% Thus, we assume  values (i.e., $|\V\!X|, |\V Y| \in \mathbb N$).
% In this section, let's assume that all variables can take on only finitely many possible values
%     (i.e., $|\V\!X|, |\V Y| \in \mathbb N$).
\paragraph{Measures and Conditioning.}
Suppose that $\Omega$ is a finite set. 
A \emph{probability distribution} $\mu$ over $\Omega$ is essentially a function 
% $\mu : \V\!\X \to [0,1]$ such that $\sum_{x \in \V X} \mu(x) = 1$.
$\mu : \Omega \to [0,1]$ such that $\sum_{\omega \in \Omega} \mu(\omega) = 1$.
This means $\mu$ is a vector of shape 
% $\V\! X$,
$\Omega$ 
satisfying $\mu \ge 0$ and $\mu \cdot \mat 1 = 1$. 
% We write $\Delta \V\!X$ for the set of all distributions over (the values of) $X$,
% which is also known as the \emph{probability simplex}.
The \emph{probability simplex} $\Delta \Omega$ is defined as the set of all probability distributions over $\Omega$. 
The \emph{support} of a distribution $\mu$
    is the set $\Supp \mu := \{ \omega \in \Omega : \mu(\omega) > 0 \}$
    of outcomes that have positive probability.
For $U \subseteq \Omega$, called \emph{events},
    define $\mu(U) := \sum_{x \in U} \mu(x)$. 
% Specifically, the event $X{=}x$ 
% The prototypical event is of the form $X{=}x$. 
While we just defined $\mu$ on events $U$ of $\Omega$ in terms of $\mu(\omega)$ for elements $\omega \in \Omega$, we remark that, in general (i.e., beyond the finite case), it has to be the other way around: 
a probability distribution is defined as an object that assigns probability to events in a way that is compatible with intuitions from the finite case we have just described.


The standard way of updating a probability distribution based on new evidence is conditioning.
Given a subset $A \subseteq \Omega$, the conditional measure
$\mu \mid A$ is defined by
$(\mu \mid A)(x) := \frac{1}{\mu(A)} \mathbbm 1[x \in A] \mu(x)$.
% In other words, 
That quantity is also given a shorter and more common name: $\mu(x \mid A)$. 
From this definition, it is easy to recover the usual definition of conditional probability:
$\mu(U \mid A) = \mu(U \cap A) / \mu(A)$. 
There is just one caveat: this formula is not meaningful when $\mu(A) = 0$; in this case, we leave the conditional probability undefined.
Indeed, if $\mu(A) = 0$, it is arguably appropriate to say $\mu(U \mid A) = p$ for \emph{every} $p\in[0,1]$, because there is a sequence of probability distributions $\{ \mu_k \}_{k \in \mathbb N}$ converging to $\mu$ that all $\mu_k(U \mid A) = p$ for all $k$. 

%% adding variables.
\paragraph{Probability via Variables.}
Our notation for representing and manipulate probability distributions will make heavy use of the notion of a variable, as developed in \cref{ssec:basic-vars}. 
Namely, we almost always work with probability distributions over the values of a variable. This just a notational convenience, since we can always define a variable $W$ with possible values $\V W := \Omega$.  
Working with variables confers us a number of benefits,
the first of which is 
% For now, we mention only that it allows us to 
to enable standard notation in the AI community:
given a distribution $\mu \in \Delta \V\!X$ over the values of $X$,
we also write $\mu(X)$ to specify $\mu$ and its type in a compact way.
% we write $\mu(X)$ in place of $\mu$ to emphasize that $\mu \in \Delta \V \! X$ in a compact way. 
% To a reader paying close attention, this definition might seem dangerous.
Since $\mu : \V W \to [0,1]$ is a function, we have already defined $\mu(W)$ to be a variable, but fortunately that variable encodes exactly the same information as $\mu$ itself.


%  $\mu(\mat X) = \mu(X_1, \ldots, X_n)$
A \emph{joint distribution} $\mu(\mat X) = \mu(X_1, \ldots, X_n)$ over a finite (indexed) set of variables $\mat X = \{X_1, \ldots, X_n\}$ is just a distribution over joint settings of all variables---i.e, a distribution over $\V \mat X$. 
%TODO: the above is awkward.
If $\mu(\mat X)$ is a joint distribution and $X \in \mat X$, then we write $\mu(X)$ for its \emph{marginal} on $X$, which is given by
\[
    \mu(X{=}x) = \mu(X)(x) := \sum_{\substack{\mat x \in \V \mat X \\ \mat x[X] = x}} \mu(\mat x) .
\]
It is called a marginal because of the special case of two variables: a joint distribution $\mu(X,Y)$ may be viewed as a grid of numbers summing to 1, whose rows correspond to values of $X$, and whose columns correspond to values of $Y$. 
If we were to write the sum $\sum_{y \in \V Y} \mu(x,y)$ of each row $x$ in the margin, this would give the marginal distribution on $X$. 


% The conditioned distribution $\mu|X{=}x$ is also written $\mu(\mat X \mid X{=}x)$, or, in abbreviated form as $\mu(Y|x)$ in contexts where the conditioning variable $X$ is unambiguous. 
To \emph{condition} a joint distribution $\mu(\mat X)$ on a variable $X \in \mat X$ is to form an indexed set of conditioned distributions $\mu(\mat X \mid X) = \{ ~(\mu|X{=}x) ~\}_{x \in \V\!X}$, one for each possible value of $X$. 
% The cpd $\mu(Y|X)$
We can also refer to such objects without reference to a joint distribution.
%
%
A \emph{conditional probability distribution (cpd)} on $Y$ given $X$ is a function $p : \V X \to \Delta \V Y$ that, for each $x \in \V\!X$, yields a probability distribution over $Y$,
which is written in any of the following equivalent notations:
\[ 
% $
p(x) ~=~ p|x ~=~ p(Y | X{=}x) ~=~ p(Y | x) \quad \in \Delta \V Y.
% $
\]
Cpds are also called \emph{channels} in information theory. 
Just like we write $\mu(X)$ for a distribution over the values of $X$, we
write $p(Y|X)$ for a cpd on $Y$ given $X$. 
In the finite case, cpds coincide with \emph{stochastic matrices}: matrices whose columns correspond to values of $Y$, rows correspond to values of $X$, and such that the sum of each row equals 1. 
We will use alternate notation (such as $\mat P_{Y|X}$) when we want to view $p(Y|X)$ as a matrix.

We typically write $\X$ for the set of all variables relevant to a given context. If $X,Y \in \X$, then we write $\mu(Y|X)$ for the cpd given by first conditioning $\mu(\X)$ on $X$, and then marginalizing each conditional distribution to $Y$. 
% Now, $\mu(Y|X)$ too is a variable 
By regarding $\mu(Y|X)$ as a function of $Y$ and $X$, it too can be viewed a real-valued variable (just like $\mu(X)$). 
% This now explains 
% Observe that $\mu(\X \mid X)$ 
% We can deal with the 
% In this context, the un-definedness of $\mu(Y|X)$ 
% Recall that the components of $\mu(Y|X)$
We can now state \emph{chain rule for probability}, a simple but incredibly important fact:
% \begin{equation}
    $\mu(X,Y) = \mu(X) \mu(Y|X)$.
% \end{equation}
% Unpacking our definition of what it means for it to be true that two variables are equal, 
This standard formula is typically viewed as shorthand for 
\[
    \forall (x,y) \in \V(X,Y).\quad \mu(X{=}x,Y{=}y) = \mu(X{=}x) \mu(Y{=}y|X{=}x),
\]
a view that also demands a caveat: ``whenever $\mu(X{=}x) > 0$, so that $\mu(Y{=}y|X{=}x)$ is defined''. 
% and is essentially just many closely related instances of the definition of the conditional probability of one event given another. 
% But the shorter version also has another benefit: 
However, since $\mu(X,Y)$, $\mu(X)$, and $\mu(Y|X)$ are all variables,
    the equality $\mu(X,Y) = \mu(X)\mu(Y|X)$ is simply true without caveats.
Why?  When $\mu(X{=}x) = 0$, then $\mu(Y{=}y|X{=}x)$ is undefined, meaning 
    it has no definitional constraint (i.e., $\Gamma(\mu(Y{=}y|X{=}x))$)---but no matter what value we select for $\mu(Y{=}y|X{=}x)$, the result still holds, because 
    % that value is later multiplied by zero.
    the question is whether or not that value times zero equals zero. 
% (Which it does.)
%    
% Moreover, the fact that $\mu(Y|X{=}x)$ is undefined can now be captured simply by not adding a constraint in $\Gamma(\mu(Y|X))$ connecting the value of $\mu(Y|X)$ to the value of $\mu(X,Y)$ in such cases. 
%
% Yet this equation, unlike the definition of a conditional probability for events, holds 
% Yet here, we no longer need to carve out a special caveat for conditioning on probability zero events; that case is handled automatically by implicit underlying constraints.

\paragraph{Variables and Random Variables.}
    \label{sec:var-randomvar}
In the context of a probability distribution $\mu \in \Delta \Omega$,
% a \emph{random variable} is a function $X : \Omega \to S$, where $S$ is a set called the domain of $X$. In serivce of unified notation, let $\V\!X := S$ denote the domain of the random variable $X$. 
a \emph{random variable} is a function $X : \Omega \to \V X$, where $\V\! X$ is some set called the \emph{domain} of $X$.
% Although the formalism may appear quite different, it is fundamentally very similar to our notion of a variable, a connection we explore.
Despite the superficial simiarity induced by our choice of notation, random variables and variables are different formal objects;
    hence the mantra, 
    ``a random variable is neither random nor a variable''. 
Yet at an even deeper level, variables and random variables are interchangable, and fundementally represent the same concept, as we now explore. 

Whereas the traditional foundations of probability start with a sample space $\Omega$ and defines random variables $X : \Omega \to \V\!X$ in terms of it, 
probabilistic modeling is often done the other way around in practice: one starts with variables $\X$ of interest, and defines $\Omega := \V\!\X$ to be the joint settings of those variables. 
Under that definition of $\Omega$ a variable $X \in \X$ can be viewed as a random variable $\hat X : \V\!\X \to \V\!X$ that selects the value of $X$ from a joint setting of all variables.  
% Conversely, 
The converse not well appreciated, 
    perhaps because it requires one to think about
    the constraints involved in defining a variable.
% Still, given 
% Given an arbitrary random variable $Z : $
If $\Omega = \Delta \V\!X$, and  
    $\hat Z : \V\!\X \to \V Z$
    is an arbitrary random variable, 
    we can regard $\hat Z$ as a variable $Z$, and include it in the set $\X' := \X \cup \{ \hat Z \}$ of all variables.
When we do so,  
there is a natural 1-1 correspondence between distributions $\mu \in \Delta \V\!\X$ over the original variables, and ``extended'' distributions 
$\bar\mu \in \Delta \V\!\X'$ in which variable $Z$ and the function $\hat Z$ applied to the other variables coincide (formally, where $\bar\mu(\hat Z(\X) = Z)=1$).

%
Although the two perspectives seem to be equally expressive, we opt for the one in which the variables $\X$ are primitive, rather than the one in which the sample space $\Omega$ is primitive. 
After all, we are interested in modeling epistemic states that undergo structural changes, and it is more natural to add and remove variables of interest, than it is to change sample spaces and figure out how to properly translate the relevant random variables on them.  
% We have already seen one benefit of this, in our compact discussion of 
We will see an even deeper connection between the two ways of thinking about (random) variables in \cref{chap:PDG-cat}.

\paragraph{%Dependence and 
    Independence.} 
Suppose that $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are (random) variables and $\mu(X,Y,Z)$ is a distribution over them.
The variables $X$ and $Y$ are \emph{independent} (according to $\mu$) iff $\mu(X,Y) = \mu(X)\mu(Y)$.
Often it is the case that two variables are independent only when we control for something else.
The variable ${X}$ is \emph{conditionally independent of ${Y}$ given ${Z}$} 
(according to $\mu$),  denoted 
 % ${X} \CI_\mu {Z} \mid {Y}$, 
$\mu \models {X} \CI {Y} \mid {Z}$, 
only if $\mu(X | Z) \mu(Y | Z) = \mu(X,Y \mid Z)$,
or equivalently, if
$\mu(X,Z) \mu(Y,Z) = \mu(X,Y,Z) \mu(Z)$. 
% By multiplying both sides by $\mu(Z)^2$,
% If $X$ and $Y$ are not variables, but rather events, then they are independent iff the same formula holds. 
Precisely the same formulas define (conditional) independence
    when $X$,$Y$, and $Z$ are not events, but rather events
    (modulo the fact that conditioning on an event of probability zero is undefined).



%%% perhaps this can wait for QIM section...
% We say that $X$ \emph{determines} $Y$, and write $\mu \models X \tto Y$ only if
% for all $x \in \V\!X$, there is at most one value of $Y$ that has positive probability, i.e.,  $\#\{ y \in \V Y : \mu(X{=}x,Y{=}y) > 0 \} \le 1$.
% It is not hard to see that $X \tto Y$ if and only if there exists a function $f : \V\!X \to \V Y$ such that $\mu(f(X) = Y) = 1$. 


\paragraph{Expectation.%
    % and Utility
    } 
If $\mu$ is a probability over $\Omega$, and $X$ is random variable 
whose possible values are vectors of a given shape(i.e., $\V \! X \subseteq \Rext^I$), then the \emph{expectation} of $X$ with respect to $\mu$ is intuitively its mean or average value.
Depending on which is clearer in context, 
    an expectation may be notated in either of the following two ways:
\[
    \Ex_{\omega \sim \mu} \Big[ X(\omega) \Big]
        = \Ex_{\mu}[ X ]  
        := \sum_{\omega \in \Omega} \mu(\omega) X(\omega).
\]
In some cases, we omit the brackets to reduce clutter and improve readability.
For a fixed random variable $X$, the expectation operator $\mu \mapsto \Ex_\mu[X] : [0,1]^{\V\! X} \to \Rext^I$ is a linear function of the probability distribution $\mu$.


Expectations and probabilities are closely related to convexity. 
% In a sense, the probability simplex $\Delta \Omega$ is the prototypical convex set. 
% \mathbbm
% For instance, if $A \in \Rext^{I \times J}$ is a matrix, then
% the image of $\mu(X) \mapsto \Ex_\mu[f]$.
For instance, 
the convex hull of $A \subseteq \Rext^I$ 
is set of possible expectations over the extreme points of $A$,
or more formally,
\[
    \mathrm{conv}(A) = \im 
        \Big( \Delta \mathrm{Ext}(A) \ni \mu \mapsto \Ex_{v \sim \mu} [ v ] \Big).
\]
Thus, if $A$ is convex, to specify $a \in A$, it suffices to specify a probability distribution over $\mathrm{Ext}(A)$.  
% Such distributions are called \emph{barycentric coordinates} for $A$.
The components of a distribution $\mu \in \Delta \mathrm{Ext}(A)$ are called \emph{barycentric coordinates} for the element $a = \Ex_{v \sim \mu}[v] \in A$.

% For instance, $\mathrm{Ext}(\Delta \Omega) = \{ \delta_{\omega} : \omega \in \Omega \}$. 
% If $A$ is a convex set with $|\mathrm{Ext}(A)| \in \mathbb N$,
% then $A$ is the image of a linear map ....

\subsection{Probability, In General}
    \label{ssec:gen-prob}

The time has come for us to bite the bullet and describe how probability actually works, when a finite representation is insufficient. 
The material here can be interesting and instructive,
    and it is certainly a necessary foundation for our results that talk about distributions over real numbers.
Still, we reiterate that the full account of measure theory needed to define probability in general is more than is necessary to get a deep conceptual understanding of the present work. 

\paragraph{Measures.}
A \emph{measurable space} $(\Omega, \mathcal F)$ is a set $\Omega$,
called the \emph{outcome space}, together with a collection $\mathcal F \subseteq 2^\Omega$ of subsets of $\Omega$, which considered \emph{measurable}, and called \emph{events}. 
The elements of $\Omega$, should be thought of \emph{possible outcomes} or \emph{possible worlds} for in the model.
The set $\mathcal F$ of events must also be an algebra, meaning that it contains $\Omega$, and is closed under complement and countable union---%
that is, $\Omega \in \mathcal F$, if $U \in \mathcal F$ then $\Omega \setminus U \in \mathcal F$, and if $U_1, U_2, \ldots \in \mathcal F$, then $U_1 \cup U_2 \cup \cdots \in \mathcal F$.  
% One should think of $\mathcal A = 2^\Omega$ as consisting of every 
% For all but a few select places, one can ignore $\mathcal F_\Omega$ in this dissertation.
% Often in probabilistic modeling, and in this dissertation in particular, the $\mathcal F_\Omega$.
When $\Omega$ is finite, we allow all subsets to be measured by defining $\mathcal F := 2^\Omega$,
    and there is also a standard choice for most other spaces of interest, such as when $\Omega$ is a convex subset of real numbers, called its \emph{Standard Borel Space}. 
Either way, we will typically leave $\mathcal F$ implicit after this chapter, referring to a measurable space with the same symbol as its sample space $\Omega$. 

A \emph{measure} $\mu$ over a measurable space $(\Omega, \mathcal F)$ is a function $\mu : \mathcal F \to [0,\infty]$ with two additional properties: $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$, and,
for every countable collection $\{ U_i \}_{i \in \mathbb N}$
of pairwise disjoint measurable sets (i.e., where each $U_i \in \mathcal F$ and $U_i \cap U_j = \emptyset$),  we have that
$\sum_{i \in \mathbb N} \mu(U_i) = \lambda( \cup_{i \in \mathbb N}~U_i)$. 
A \emph{probability distribution} (or probability measure) is a measure $\mu$ with the additional property that $\mu(\Omega) = 1$. 
% satisfying the three Kolmogorov axioms:
% % \begin{enumerate}
% %     \item 
% \begin{align*}
%     &\Pr(\emptyset) = 0, \qquad
%     \Pr(\Omega) = 1, \\
%     \quad\text{and}\qquad&
%     \forall U, V \in \mathcal F.\quad 
%         U \cap V = \emptyset \implies \Pr(U \cup V) = \Pr(U) + \Pr(V).
% \end{align*}
%
Intuitively, these three properties are quite intuitive: $\emptyset$ is an event that cannot occur and hence has probability zero,
$\Omega$ is an event that always occurs and hence has probability 1, 
and if events cannot co-occur, then the probability that one of them occurs is the sum of their probabilities. 
% \end{enumerate}
% We need a few more definitions about measures. 

We will need two additional concepts about measures.
First, if $\mu$ and $\nu$ are measures over a space $(X, \mathcal F)$, 
and $\nu(U) = 0$ implies $\mu(U) = 0$ for all $U \in \mathcal F$, then
$\mu$ is \emph{absolutely continuous} with respect to $\nu$, also written $\nu \ll \mu$.
Second, if $\Omega$ comes with a topology $\mathcal T$ (see \cref{prelim:topo} for definitions) and $\mu(U) > 0$ for every non-empty open set $U \in \mathcal F \cap \mathcal T$, then $\mu$ is said to be \emph{strictly positive} (with respect to $\cal T$).

\paragraph{Statistics and (Random) Variables.} 
If $(\Omega, \mathcal F)$ and $(Y, \mathcal G)$ are two measurable spaces, then
a function $f : \Omega \to Y$ is said to be \emph{measurable} if $f^{-1}(U) \in \mathcal F$ for all $U \in \mathcal G$. 
In a context where one is interested in probabilities over $\Omega$, 
a measurable function $X : \Omega \to \V\!X$ is also called a \emph{random variable} or a \emph{statistic}.
% Although the formalism may appear quite different, it is fundamentally very similar to our notion of a variable, a connection we explore in the next two paragraphs.

In this more general setting, we no longer require $\V(X)$ to be a finite set, but in exchange, we still require some structure---$\V(X)$ has to be a measurable space. At a technical level, this is compatible with our previous discussion about variables, because all of our ways of constructing variables---through (indexed) sets of variables, and by applying functions---work equally well over measurable spaces. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Recall that we regard a tuple $\mat X = (X_1, \ldots, X_n)$ of variables as itself a variable, with $\V(X_1, \ldots, X_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n \V(X_i)$.
        But if each $\mathcal V(X_i)$ comes with an algebra $\mathcal F_i$ of events, then there is a natural product algebra $\mathcal F_{1:n}$ generated by complements and countable unions of events of the form $U = U_1 \times \cdots \times U_n$ with each $U_i \in \mathcal F_i$. 

    \item Similarly, recall that when $X$ is a variable and $f : \V X \to S$ is a function, we regard $f(X)$ as a variable. In this setting, we add only the minimal requirement that $S$ be a measurable space and that $f$ be a measurable function.  
\end{enumerate}
% 
% Whereas the traditional foundations of probability starts with a sample space $\Omega$ and defines random variables from it,  probabilistic modeling is done the other way around in practice: one starts with variables $\X$ of interest, and defines $\Omega := \V\!\X$ to be the joint settings of those variables. 
% With that definition, a variable $X$ can be viewed as a random variable $X : \V\!\X \to \V\!X$ that selects the value of $X$ from the joint setting.  
% Conversely, an arbitrary random variable $Z : \V\!\X \to \V Z$ can be included in the set of all variables; there is a natural 1-1 correspondence between distributions $\mu \in \Delta \V\!\X$ over the original variables, and ``extended'' distributions $\bar\mu \in \Delta \V(\X \cup Z)$ with the property that variable $Z$ and the function $Z$ applied to the other variables coincide (i.e., $\bar\mu(Z(\X) = Z)=1$).
% %
% %
% Although the two perspectives seem to be equally expressive, we opt for the variable-based one. 
% After all, we are interested in modeling epistemic states that undergo structural changes, and it is conceptually simpler to add and remove variables of interest, than it is to change sample spaces and figure out how to properly translate the random variables on them.  


\paragraph{The Radon-Nikodym Derivative.}
Suppose $\mu$ and $\nu$ are both measures over a measurable space $(X,\mathcal F)$, and $\mu \ll \nu$. 
The Radon-Nikodym theorem states that there is then a unique $\mathcal F$-measurable function $f$
such that for all $A \in \mathcal F$,
\[
    \mu(A) = \int_{A} f \,\mathrm d \nu.
\]
The function $f$ is called the \emph{Radon-Nikodym derivative} of $\mu$ with respect to $\nu$, and is denoted $\frac{\mathrm d\mu}{\mathrm d\nu} := f$.


\paragraph{Markov Kernels.}
Finally, we get to the precise notion of a conditional probability distribution (cpd) 
in this more careful framework regarding measurability.
If $(\Omega, \mathcal F)$, and $(\Omega', \mathcal G)$ are two measurable spaces, a \emph{Markov Kernel} $\kappa : \Omega \to \mathcal Y$, which we sometimes write as ``$\kappa(Y|X)$'', is a function $\kappa : X \times \mathcal G \to \mathbb R$, such that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For every $x \in X$, the map $\kappa(x, -) : \mathcal U \to [0,1]$ is a probability measure. (So $\kappa$ is also a cpd.)
    \item For every $U \in \mathcal G$, the map $\kappa(-, U) : X \to [0,1]$ is a measurable function from $\mathcal X$ to the Borel space $[0,1]$.
    Or more explicitly: for every open set $S \subseteq [0,1]$, and $U \in \mathcal G$, we have that
    $\{x : \kappa(x,U) \in S\} \in \mathcal F$. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Basic Theory of Graphs and Hypergraphs}

In this dissertation, as in much of mathematics and computer science,
the term \emph{graph} refers not to a \emph{graph}ical depiction of a function or data,
but rather to what is more commonly known as a \emph{network}. 

Graphs come in two flavors: directed and undirected. 

\begin{defn}
    A \emph{(directed) (multi)graph} $G = (N, A)$, or simply a \emph{graph}, is a set $N$ of nodes,
    and a collection $A$ of arcs, such that each $a \in A$ has a source node $\Src a \in N$ and a target node $\Tgt a \in N$.
    So, formally, the definition is
    $G = (N, A, \Src{}, \Tgt{})$, with $\Src{},\Tgt{}: A \to N$ often left implicit.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    % [Undirected (Multi) Graph]
    An \emph{undirected} (multi)graph $G = (N,E)$ is a set $N$ of vertices (or nodes)
    and a set $E$ of edges,
    each element $e \in E$ of which
    corresponds to an unordered pair of vertices $\{u,v\}$.
    More formally, there is a map
    \[
        \iota: E \to~ \faktor{ V \times V \setminus \{(v,v):v \in N\} }{ \{(u,v)\sim(v,u)\mid (u,v) \in N \times N\} }~.
    \]
    implicit in the definition of $G$, which we will write $G =
    % (V,E{,~ \color{gray}\iota})$ 
     (N,E, \iota)$ 
    only when being extra careful.
    \qedhere
\end{defn}

It is common to identify a graph $H = (N,A)$ (or an undirected graph $G = (N,E)$) with its (symmetric) adjacency matrix
\[
    \mathbb A_H = \Big[ \#\Big\{ a \in A : {\singlespacing \begin{array}{c}\Src a = u,\\ \Tgt a = v \end{array}} \Big\} \Big]_{(u,v) \in N \times N}
    \qquad
    \mathbb A_G = \Big[
    \#\{ e \in E : \iota(e) = \{u,v\}         \Big]_{(u,v) \in N\times N}~~,
\]
in part because there is a natural bijection between
(undirected) multigraphs and (symmetric) square matrices
over the natural numbers.  
For example:
\[
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & 1 & 2 \\
        1 & 0 & 0 \\
        2 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \qquad
    \leftrightsquigarrow
    \qquad
    \begin{tikzpicture}[center base]
        \begin{scope}
            % \node at (0:1) (a) {a};
            % \node at (120:1) (b) {b};
            % \node at (-120:1) (c) {c};
            \node at (0,0) (a) {a};
            \node at (1,0) (b) {b};
            \node at (-1,0) (c) {c};
        \end{scope}
        \draw[-] (a) to (b);
        % \draw (a) to[bend left] (b);
        % \draw (b) to[bend left] (a);
        
        \draw[-] (a) to[bend left] (c);
        \draw[-] (a) to[bend right] (c);
        
        \path[every loop/.style={}] (c) edge[loop above] (c);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\]

A (directed) graph has more information than an undirected one.
There are some obvious ways to get a directed graph from an undirected one (add an arrow going in both directions) and to get an undirected graph from a directed one: forget the direction of the arc, making it an edge.
These choices are illustrated in the following diagram:
\[ 
\begin{tikzcd}
\text{(Directed) Graphs} \ar[r,bend left,"\mathit{forget}"]&
\text{Undirected Graphs}
\ar[l,bend left,"\mathit{annotate}"]
\end{tikzcd};
\]
$\mathit{forget} \circ \mathit{annotate}$
is the identity on undirected graphs, but
$\mathit{anotate} \circ \mathit{forget}$ is 
not the identity on (directed) graphs.
% Technically, this makes $\mathit{forget}$ a \emph{retraction}, and $\mathit{annotate}$ a \emph{section}.
These choices are essentially locked in if we want to preseve the validity of the representation in terms of square binary matrices. 

A \emph{clique} of an undirected graph $G = (N,E)$ is a subset $C \subseteq N$ of its vertices, that are all connected by edges---that is, such that every distinct pair $\{x,y\}$ of vertices $x,y \in C$ is a member of $E$.  We write $\mathrm{cliques}(G)$ for the set of all cliques in a graph. 

\begin{defn}
    A bipartite graph $G = (L, R, E)$ is a graph $(L \sqcup R, E)$ whose
    vertices are partiioned into two components $V = L \sqcup R$, 
    and whose edges $E \subset L \times R$ are only between $L$ and $R$.

%     A directed bipartite graph $G = (L, R, E)$ is a bipartite graph $(L, R, E)$ whose edges $E \subset (L \times R) \cup (R \times L)$ are directed. 
%     \end{defn} }


\begin{defn}
    A \emph{hypergraph} $G = (V, \mathcal E)$ is a set $V$ of vertices,
    and a collection $\Ed$ of \emph{hyperedges}, which correspond to finite
    subsets of $V$. 
\end{defn}

An ordinary undirected graph may be viewed as the special case in which every hyperedge contains two vertices.

\begin{prop} 
There is a natural bijection between hypergraphs and bipartite graphs:
% \def\bitgr{\mathit{BG}}
\def\bigr{\mathit{bipart}}
% \def\bitgr{\mathit{HG}}
\def\hygr{\mathit{hyper}}
\begin{align*}
    \bigr(V, \mathcal E) &:=  (V, \mathcal E, \{(v, E) \in V \times \mathcal E : v \in E \} ) \\
    % (L, \{\{x \in L : \} \}) &\maspfrom (L, R, E)
    \hygr(L, R, E) &:= (L, \{\{v \in L : (v,r) \in E\} : r \in R\}),
\end{align*}    
    \[
        \bigr \circ \hygr = \mathrm{id}_{BG}
        \quad\text{and}\quad
        \hygr \circ \bigr = \mathrm{id}_{HG}.
    \]
\end{prop}

The consequences of this can be unintuitive.
It is common to think of bipartite graphs as a strict (particularly nice) special case of ordinary undirected graphs, which themselves are a strict (particularly easy to draw) strict special case of hypergraphs.  
By transitivity, one might expect bipartite graphs to naturally be an extremely strict special case of hypergraphs---yet in fact they are naturally isomorphic. 

% \begin{defn}
%     A \emph{directed} hypergraph $(N, \mathcal A)$ is a set $N$ of nodes,
%     and a collection $\Ar$ of hyperarcs, each of which has a set $S_a \subset N$ of
%     source variables and a set $T_a \subset N$ of target variables.        
% \end{defn}

\begin{defn}
        \label{defn:hypergraph}
    A \emph{directed hypergraph}
    consists of a set $\N$ of nodes
    and a set $\Ar$ of 
    directed hyperedges, or \emph{hyperarcs};
    each hyperarc  $a \in \Ar$ is associated with
        a set $\Src a \subseteq \N$ of
    source nodes and a set $\Tgt a \subseteq \N$ of target nodes.    %
    We write $\ed {\scriptstyle a}{S}{T} \in \Ar$ to specify a
    hyperarc $a \in \Ar$ together with its sources $S = \Src a$ and targets $T = \Tgt a$.
\end{defn}

Nodes that are neither a source nor a target of any hyperarc will
seldom have any effect on our constructions; the other nodes can
be recovered from the hyperarcs 
by selecting $\N_{\Ar} := \bigcup_{a \in \Ar} \Src a \cup \Tgt a$. 
If necessary, we can often add an ``identity'' arc 
    $N \to N$ for any node $N \in \N \setminus \N_{\Ar}$. 
% Thus, we often leave $\N$ implicit,
For these reasons, we often leave $\N$ implicit,
referring to the directed hypergraph simply as $\Ar$.

A directed hypergraph $(N, \mathcal A)$ can be (equivalently) defined
as an (ordinary) directed graph $(2^N, \Ar)$ whose set of nodes is the powerset of some set $N$.

% \begin{defn}
The \emph{dual} of the hypergraph $G = (V, \mathcal E)$ is
the hypergraph
% \[
$
    \check G := (\mathcal E, \{\{e \in \mathcal E : v \in e\} : v \in V\}),
$
% \]
which in some sense, has swapped the roles of the vertices and the hyperedges.
Interestingly, the concept applies equally well for directed hypergraphs, and the definition is even more symmetric---yet we are not aware of any published work on subject.

\begin{defn}
    The \emph{dual} of a directed hypergraph $\mathcal H = (N, \Ar)$ is 
    \(
        \check{\mathcal H} := (\mathcal A, N)
    \),
    where
    % \[
    $
    \check{\Src n} = \{ a \in \Ar : n \in \Tgt a\} \quad\text{and}\quad
    \check{\Tgt n} = \{ a \in \Ar : n \in \Src a\}.
    % \qedhere
    % \]
    $
\end{defn}

% \begin{prop}
We now verify that $\check{\check{\mathcal H}} = \mathcal H$.
Observe that 
\begin{align*}
    \check{\check{\Src a}}
    &= \{ n \in N : a \in \check{\Tgt n} \} \\
    &= \{ n \in N : a \in \{ a' \in \Ar :  n \in \Src {a'} \} \} \\
    &= \{ n \in N : n \in \Src a\} 
    = \Src a.
\end{align*}
% \end{prop}
A symmetric argument etablishes that $\Tgt a = \check{\check{\Tgt a}}$. 
% What does this look like?
% To visualize . 
% One might wonder why $\check\Src n$ is definde in terms of $\Tgt a$ instead of $\Src a$.

We remark that
the left and center diagrams on the top can be viewed as (the hypergraphs corresponding to) qualitative Bayesian Networks, by regarding X,Y,Z and A,B,C,D as variables, and imagining that there is a (randomized) causal determination occuring along each arc. 
% The structures that arise from causal models
One can also imagine an analogue with cycles---resuling in perhaps a (randomized) causal model of the given shape.  But a causal model has one equation corresponding to each variable, and the corresponding hypergraphs thus has exactly one hyperarc leading to it. 
In the dual hypergraphs, one should view the nodes as processes and the arcs as wires. Such a hypergrah has precisely one hyperarc leading out of every node. When wires branch, one imagines a copy; when two arcs point to the same process (as in process 4, in the middle center), that process takes both of the wires as inputs.
In the duals of hypergraphs corresponding to causal models, there are no two-tailed arrows, which might be thought of as a ``merge''. 
Yet it is not clear how to merge the values of two variables, when they are not the same, in general---especially if we expect associativity and commutativity, as we do with \emph{copy}.

% \section{A Review of Graphical Models}
\section{Graphical Models}

% Broadly speaking, probabilistic graphical levels 
Like variables themselves, graphical models exist on two levels: a qualitative or structural one, and a quantiative observational one.
%
a \emph{graphical model structure}, or a \emph{qualitative graphical model} is a (directed) (hyper)graph whose vertices $\X$ are variables, and whose (hyper)edges somehow indicate local influences between variables.
The quantiative form then annotates those concepts with data.
A \emph{probabilistic graphical model},
or simply  ``graphical model'', is a
graphical model structure together with  \emph{quantitative} or probabilistic information about these local influences.

The purpose of a graphical model, at least historically, is to be a compact representation of a probability distribution (by exploiding independencies). 
Thus, a graphical model $\cal M$
typically represents a joint probability distribution $\Pr_{\!\cal M}
 \in \Delta \V\!\X$ over its variables.
% \discard{
%     Although there is often more to the story,
%     it can typically be
%     expressed as a product
%     $\Pr_{\!\cal M}(\X) \propto \prod_{E \in \Ed} \phi_{E}(E)$
%     of factors $\boldsymbol   \phi = 
%     \{ \phi_E : \V E \to \mathbb R_{\ge 0} \}_{E \in \Ed}$
%     over a hypergraph $(\X, \Ed)$ closely related to the structure of $\cal M$.
%     For this reason, some authors use the term ``graphical model'' to refer to a tuple $(\X ,\Ed, \boldsymbol\phi)$,
%     i.e., a factor graph.
%     PDGs, however, do not represent probabilities this way.}

We now review the basics of the most important classes of graphical models used in practice:
Bayesian Networks, which are based on directed (acyclic) graphs, and
what we will call factor graphs, which are based on undirected graphs. 
What follows is really a barebones sketch of the graphical models context for the ideas we present in this dissertation; for a proper treatment, we refer readers to 
    \citet{koller2009probabilistic}.
% These two models 
    
\subsection{Bayesian Networks and Variants}

A qualitative Bayesian Network (BN),  is an acyclic directed graph $G = (\X, A)$ over a set of variables $\X$. 
An arc $X {\to} Y \in A$ intuitiely reflects a possibility that $X$ can influence $Y$. 
The absence, of an edge, therefore, reflects some kind of (conditional) independence. 
One standard way to say this is that
\textit{every variable is conditionally independent of its non-descendents given its parents}.
Another famous (and more algorithmic) characterization of the same independences is the \emph{d-separation} criterion  \cite{geiger-pearl-d-separation}. 
It is helpful to look at some examples.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[xscale=1.3,center base]
        \node[draw,circle] (X) at (-1,0) {$X$};
        \node[draw,circle] (Y) at (0,0) {$Y$};
        \node[draw,circle] (Z) at (1,0) {$Z$};
        \draw[->] (X) to (Y);
        \draw[->] (Y) to (Z);
    \end{tikzpicture};~~~
    \begin{tikzpicture}[xscale=1.3,center base]
        \node[draw,circle] (X) at (-1,0) {$X$};
        \node[draw,circle] (Y) at (0,0) {$Y$};
        \node[draw,circle] (Z) at (1,0) {$Z$};
        \draw[->] (X) to (Y);
        \draw[->] (Y) to (Z);
    \end{tikzpicture};~~~
    \begin{tikzpicture}[xscale=1.3,center base]
        \node[draw,circle] (X) at (-1,0) {$X$};
        \node[draw,circle] (Y) at (0,0) {$Y$};
        \node[draw,circle] (Z) at (1,0) {$Z$};
        \draw[->] (Y) to (X);
        \draw[->] (Y) to (Z);
    \end{tikzpicture};~~~
    \begin{tikzpicture}[xscale=1.3,center base]
        \node[draw,circle] (X) at (-1,0) {$X$};
        \node[draw,circle] (Y) at (0,0) {$Y$};
        \node[draw,circle] (Z) at (1,0) {$Z$};
        \draw[->] (X) to (Y);
        \draw[->] (Z) to (Y);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The first, second, and third, all give the same independencies: $X$ and $Z$ are conditionally independent given $Y$.  But the last is different: it states that $X$ and $Y$ are independent (but $Z$ can have an arbitrary relation with both).
This intuition can be further clarified once we add probabilities.

A quantiative BN, or simply a BN, 
    $\mathcal B = (\X, A, \mathbb P)$ 
    is a qualitative BN $(\X, A)$ together with a collection 
    of cpds $\mathbb P = \{ P_X( X \mid \Pa(X)) \}_{X \in \Pa(X)}$,
    one for each variable given its parents. 
A BN then induces a joint probability distribution 
\begin{equation}
    \Pr\nolimits_{\cal B}(\X) := \prod_{X \in \X} P_X( X \mid \Pa(X) ),
        \label{eq:bn-product}
\end{equation}
which indeed satisfies the independence properties specified its underlying qualitaitve BN. Moreover, its conditional marginals are the ones specified by 
Indeed, the factorization \eqref{eq:bn-product} is yet another euquivalent characterization of the conditional independencies of this graph.  
% because the underlying graph is directed, this formula can be viewed as
% the chain rule of proability
% $\Pr(X_1, \ldots, X_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n \Pr(X_i \mid X_1, \ldots, X_{i-1})$, 
This quantiative view \eqref{eq:bn-product} is the primary way that the broader modern machine learning community views BNs.
It also suggests a way of generalizing BNs to handle cycles and more: simply use the same equation.
However, the resulting object will typically not be a probability distribution: its sum over all values of $\X$ may not equal 1. 
But, in principle, it could be normalized;
    this approach leads to the second major class of graphical models.  



\subsection{Markov Random Fields, Factor Graphs, and Variants}

Now, suppose $G = (\X, E)$ is an undirected graph over a set of variables.
By interpreting an edge $X{-}Y \in E$ as a possibility of (bi-directional) influence between $X$ and $Y$
% there are three different (but closely related), it also becomes a qualitative graphical model.
A distribution $\mu$ is said to be a \emph{Markov Random Field} for $G$ if it satisfies one of the following properites:

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item (pairwise) 
        If $X \ne Y$ and $\{X, Y\} \notin E$, then $X \CI Y \mid \X \setminus \{X, Y\}$.  
    \item (local) 
        For each $X \in \X$, let $\partial_E(X) = \{ Y \in \X : \{Y,X\} \in E \}$ be the set of then $X \CI \X \mid \partial_G(X)$.  
    \item (global)
        If $(X,Y) \notin E$, then $X \CI Y \mid \X \setminus \{X, Y\}$.  
    \item (factorization) 
        There exists a collection of functions 
        $\{ \phi_{\mat X} : \V(\mat X)\to \mathbb R_{\ge 0} \}_{\mat X \in \mathrm{cliques}(G)}$
        indexed by the cliques of the graph $G$
        whose product is the distribution $\mu$,
        i.e.,
        \[
            \mu(\X) = \prod_{\mat X \in \mathrm{cliques}(G)} \phi_K(\mat X).
        \]
\end{itemize}

In general, conditions are distinct, with (global) $\implies$ (local) $\implies$ (pairwise). 
However, if we restrict to \emph{positive} distributions (i.e., $\forall \omega \in \V\!\X.~\mu(\omega) > 0 $), then all four conditions are equivalent.
The connection to the factorization property is a very deep result, known as the \emph{Clifford-Hammersly Theorem}, or the \emph{fundemental theorem of graphical models}. 

% This suggests we can approach the idea from 
If we care only about such distributions, this suggests another approach to the same idea: throw away the graph $G$, multiply together collection of functions $\{ \phi_{j} : \V \! X_{j} \to \mathbb R_{\ge 0} \}_{j \in J}$ (for some arbitrary index set $J$), and then renormalize. 
%
The bipartite graph that corresponds naturally to this hypergraph is called a \emph{factor graph}. 
More precisely, a factor graph has two kinds of nodes factors (drawn as squares), and variables (circles), with an edge between them if the factor depends on the variable.
We will see more details in \cref{sec:factor-graphs}.


\subsection{Other Graphical Models}

Many other graphical models have been proposed as well, although
the vast majority are variants on the two we have already described. 
We now give a quick overview of some of these representations, although this list is far from complete. 
% There are other ways of describing 

There are \emph{conditional} Bayesian Networks and Causal Bayesian Networks, both of which are called CBNs, and, fortuantely, both of which make the same modification: marking some variables as ``observed'', so that they do not require probability distributions. 
Writing $\U$ for the observed variables and $\V$ for the unobserved ones, a CBN $\mathcal B$ represents a cpd $\Pr_{\mathcal B}(\mathcal V \mid \mathcal U)$. 
%
\emph{Conditional random fields (CRFs)} are an analogue for factor graphs/MRFs.

Graphs with both directed and undirected edges have also been studied. The most widely known graphical model of this kind is called a \emph{chain graph}, in part because it can be seen as a way of connecting conneted components (themselves factor graphs) along a directed acylcic chain.
People have also considered other ways of making precise the notion of a cyclic baysian network (aside from multiply together factors for a cyclic network), including unrolling it and looking at fixed points---such as dyanmic Bayesian Networks, and a related cut-parameterized approaches to looking at fixed points \cite{Baier_2022}.

A related notion is that of a \emph{Dependency Networks (DNs)}, which is like a cylic Bayesian Network, and defines a probability distribuiton as a fixed point of a Markov Chain. 
% DNs can also be inconsistent in a sense, 
``Consistent'' DNs turn out to be an alternate way of parameterizing undirected graphical models.
There is also a notion of an \emph{inconsistent} DN, which turns out to be a very special case of a representation developed in this thesis (\cref{chap:relent-soup}).


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \section{A Primer on Information Theory}
\section{Information Theory}

% Perhaps surprisingly
Information theory is the study of when computational tasks
    (such as communicating in a noisy environment, 
        or )
    are possible, and when they are not. 
%
The field is vast and heterogenous, 
    yet much of it is built using a small set of 
    particularly nice ways of quantifying (un)certainty in a probabilistic
    context, which we will refer to throughout as \emph{information-theoretic primatives}.
These quantities are all based on the concept of log probability, or \emph{surprisal} $\I_{\mu}[ X{=}x]$, which is
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item equal to zero if the event $X{=}x$ was certain to happen (i.e., totally unsurprising), and otherwise strictly positive;
\item combines additively over independent events, just like most quantities in science.
\end{itemize}


Although not typically thought of in this way, 
    the basic information-theoretic quantities come in two flavors, mirroring the divide between qualitative and quantitative information that we saw in the presentation of graphical models. 
% We start by recounting some standard results and notation,
With the exception of these editorial comments on the theme of qualitative vs quantitative concepts, all of this material can be found in any introduction to information
theory (e.g., \citet[Chapter 1]{mackay2003information} or \citet{CoverThomas}).  

\subsection{Shannon Entropy and the Information Profile}
    \label{sec:qual-info-theory-primer}

Let $\mu$ be a probability distribution, and be $X,Y,Z$
    be (sets of) discrete (random) variables.
The \emph{information content} $\I_{\mu}[ X{=}x ] := \log \frac1{\mu(X{=}x)}$ of an event $X{=}x$ quantifies one's surprisal at learning that $X{=}x$.
    
The \emph{entropy} of $X$ is the uncertainty in $X$, when it is distributed according to $\mu$, as measured by the number of bits of information needed (in expectation) needed to determine it, if the distribution $\mu$ is known.  It is given by 
\[
    \H_\mu(X) := \sum_{x \in \V(X)} \mu(X{=}x) \log \frac{1}{\mu(X{=}x)} \qquad= -\Ex_{\mu}[\log \mu(X)],
\]
and has several very important properties. 
Chief among them, $\H_\mu(X)$ is non-negative, and equal to zero iff $X$ 
    is a constant according to $\mu$. 
The ``joint entropy'' $\H(X,Y)$ is just the entropy of the combined variable $(X,Y)$ whose values are pairs $(x,y)$ for $x \in \V(X),y \in \V(Y)$; this is the same as the entropy of the variable $X \cup Y$ when $X$ and $Y$ are themselves sets of variables. 
    % takes as input not the value of a variable

The \emph{conditional entropy} of $Y$ given $X$
measures the uncertainty present in $Y$ if one knows the value of $X$
(think: the information in $Y$ but not $X$),
and is equivalently defined as any of the following three quantities:
\[
\H_\mu( Y | X) :=
        % \quad
    ~~
    \Ex_{\mu} [~\log \nicefrac1{\mu(Y | X)}~]
        % \quad
    ~~=~~\H_\mu(X,Y) - \H_\mu(X)
        % \quad
    ~~=\Ex_{x \sim \mu(X)} [~\H_{\mu \mid X{=}x}(Y)~]    
.
\]
The fact that these three quantities coincide is a remarkable fact,
% and one that makes entropy particularly special. 
% and just one of many that make entropy paticularly special.
and one reason that entropy is particularly special. 

\begin{fact}[Entropy Chain Rule]\label{fact:entropy-chain-rule}
    If $X$ and $Y$ are random variables, then the entropy of the joint
   variable $(X,Y)$ can be written as $\H_\mu(X,Y) = 
\H_\mu( Y \mid X) + \H_\mu(X)$.
It follows that if $\mu$ is a
       distribution over the $n$ variables $X_1, \ldots, X_n$,  then
	\[ \H(\mu) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \H_\mu(X_i \mid X_1, \ldots X_{i-1}). \]
\end{fact}
% \begin{defn}[Conditional Mutual Information]\label{defn:cmi}
%    The \emph{conditional mutual information} between two (sets of) random
%     variables is defined as  
%     \[ \I_\mu(X ; Y \mid Z) := \sum_{x,y,z \in \V(X,Y,Z)} \mu(x,y,z)
%         \log\frac{\mu(z) \mu(x,y,z)}{\mu(x,z)\mu(y,z)}. \] 
% \end{defn}

The \emph{mutual information} $\I(X;Y)$,
and its conditional variant $\I(X;Y|Z)$, 
are given, respectively, by
\[
    \I_\mu(X;Y) :=
        \Ex_{\mu} \Big[ \log \frac{\mu(X,Y)}{\mu(X) \mu(Y)}\Big],
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \I(X;Y|Z):= 
        \Ex_{\mu} \Big[ \log \frac{\mu(X,Y,Z)\mu(Z)}{\mu(X,Z) \mu(Y,Z)}\Big].
\]
Both quantities are non-negative.
The former is equal to zero iff $\mu \models X \CI Y$, and the latter is equal to zero iff $\mu \models X \CI Y \mid Z$;
thus, they measure distance to independence. 


Just as conditional entropy can be written as a linear combination of unconditional entropies, so too can conditional mutual information be written as a linear combination of unconditional mutual informations: $\I(X;Y|Z) = \I(X;(Y,Z)) - \I(X;Z)$.  
Thus conditional quantities are easily derived from the unconditional ones. But at the same time, the unconditional versions are clearly special cases of the conditional ones; for example, $\H_\mu(X)$ is clearly the special case of $\H(X|Z)$ when $Z$ is a constant (e.g., $Z = \emptyset$). 
Furthermore, entropy and mutual information are also interdefinable and generated by linear combinations of one another. 
It is easy to verify that 
\begin{align*}
    \I_\mu(X;Y) 
    % = \H_\mu(X,Y) - \H(Y|X) - \H(X|Y)
    &= \H_\mu(X) + \H_\mu(Y) - \H_\mu(X,Y)
    \\&=  \H_\mu(X)  - \H_\mu(X|Y)
% $ and $
\\ \qquad\text{ and }\qquad
    \I_\mu(X;Y|Z)
    &= \H_\mu(X|Z) + \H_\mu(Y|Z) - \H_\mu(X,Y|Z)
    \\&= \H_\mu(X \mid Y) - \H_\mu(X \mid Y, Z);
\end{align*},
thus mutual information is derived from entropy. 
Yet on the other hand, $\I_\mu(Y;Y) = \H_\mu(Y)$ and $\I_\mu(Y;Y|X) = \H_\mu(Y|X)$---thus entropy is also a special case of mutual information. 

% Sums and differences of any of these quantities
Information theoretic quantities such as (conditional) entropy and (conditional) mutual information for different subsets of a set of variables $\X$ fit together with an inclusion-exclusion rule. 
% They are connected by an inclusion exclusion 
There leads to an easy graphical way to quickly read of identities such as the ones above from an \emph{information diagram}, like the shown below for three variables.

\paragraph{A Structural Information Measure.} 
We claim that all of these (entropy-based) quantities are purely ``qualitative'' notions---although, because represent real numbers (i.e., ``quantities''), we will instead use the word \emph{structural} to refer to the concept here.
One way to see this is the way these concepts interact with variables. 
Recall that $\mu(X), \mu(X,Y)$ and $\mu(Y|X)$ can all be viewed as (random) variables, that take as input values of $X$ and $Y$. 
% Unlike their counterparts, 
$\H_\mu(X)$, $\H_\mu(X,Y)$, and $\H_\mu(Y|X)$, however, 
    are not functions of the values of $X$ and $Y$, but rather functions 
    of the variables themselves. 
% Its argument is the identity of the variable $X$, 
Indeed, it makes no sense to feed $(x,y)$ as an argument to any of these concepts. 
% Another sign that entropy and its cousins are structural notions is that they are invariant to relabelings of the values.

% This is because $\H_\mu(X)$ is fundementally a
% ``qualitative'' notion,
%     that operates on the identities of variables, and not their values.

\subsection{Relative Entropy}
    \label{sec:relent-primer}

% We now move on to the quantiative 
We now move on to a second kind of information theoretic primitve, called relative entropy, or KL divergence, of one distribution from another. If $\mu, \nu \in \Delta \Omega$, then the \emph{relative entroy} of $\nu$ with respect to $\mu$ is given by:
%
\begin{align*}
    \kldiv {\mu} {\nu} 
    &:= \sum_{ \omega \in \Omega } \mu(\omega) \log \frac{ \mu(\omega) }{ \nu(\omega) }
    % \\&
    = \Ex_{\omega \sim \mu} \Big[ \log \frac{\mathrm d \mu}{\mathrm d \nu}(\omega) \Big].
\end{align*}

One critical property of relative entorpy, known as \emph{Gibbs' inequality}, is that
$\kldiv{\mu}{\nu} \ge 0$,
%  and $\kldiv{\mu}{\nu} = 0$ 
with equality if and only if $\mu = \nu$ (with probability 1). 
This is why $\thickD$ is called a ``divergence''. 
It is not, however, a ``distance measure'' in the standard sense, because it is not symmetric: typically $\kldiv{\mu}{\nu} \ne \kldiv{\nu}{\mu}$. 
%
But this is a good thing, because the concept of probabilistic discernability itself is inherrently asymmetric. 

\begin{example}
    Suppose that there are two coins: a fair one, and a double headed one. 
    One of them (although you do not know which) has been selected, and flipped; you observe the result. 

    First, suppose you believe the coin is fair, but in fact it is double-headed. 
    You observe the only possible outcome: heads. This is totally within the realm of possibility. It would take many flips to convince yourself the coin was not fair, and even then you could not be completely sure. 
    %
    Now reverse the roles: suppose that in reality, the coin is fair, but you believe it is double-headed. With probability 1/2, you observe a tails and are immediately persuaded (with certainty) that your belief is incorrect. 

    There is an inherrent asymmetry: it is far easier to ``distinguish the double-headed coin from the fair one'', than it is to ``distinguish the fair coin from the double-headed one''.
\end{example}

Relative entropy is arguably exactly the appropriate measure of discrepancy between belief and reality. 
The most obvious argument for this is the empirical one:
relative entropy has become the overwhelmingly standard measure of discrepancy between distributions used to train machine learning systems, where it is standardly known as Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence.
\Cref{chap:one-true-loss} can be viewed as a significant strengthening of this argument.


Here is a more theoretical argument, that allows us to interpret relative entorpy in terms of coding theory. 
The length of an optimal code for a sample $\omega \sim \nu$ is proportional to its surprisal $\log \nf1{\nu(\omega)}$.
Imagine that you have belief $\nu$ and the codes you are using reflect this, while in fact reality is distributed according to $\mu$.
Upon seeing $\omega$, the length of your code is $\log\frac{1}{\nu(\omega)}$, while the length of an optimal one would be $\log\frac{1}{\mu(\omega)}$. 
In expectation, the difference between these quantities,
    which is the overhead of using your mis-specified codes, is 
     $\Ex_{\omega \sim \mu}[ \log \frac{\mu(\omega)}{\nu(\omega)}] = \kldiv\mu\nu$.


% Relative entropy is extremely special, and arguably exactly the
% appropriate measure of discrepancy between belief and reality.  It has
% a clear information theoretic interpretation as 
There are a number of other results showing that relative entropy is the unique quantity with important properties of interest; treating them all is beyond the scope of this thesis.% 
\footnote{%
There are many nice axiomatizations of relative entropy;
some important ones include Renyi's \cite{renyi1961measures}, Fadeev's \cite{fadeev1957begriff}, Tom Leinster's result showing
that it is the only function satisfying three trivial regularity
properties and the chain rule, and this characterization as the unique
functor from statistical maps to the additive monoid $[0,\infty]$.  It is the
only statistical divergence that is both a Bregman divergence and an
f-divergence.  The Hessian of relative entropy is the Fisher metric, 
which is the unique metric tensor that is invariant under sufficient statistics. 
In that geometry, we will see (\cref{chap:relent-soup}) that the gradient flow of relative entropy
with respect to its first (``belief'') argument amounts to
multiplicative interpolation of probability measures, while gradient
flow of relative entropy with respect to its second (``reality'')
argument amounts to additive interpolation. 
}
%
Suffice it to say that relative entropy is an extremely special,
    and a natural measure of quantiative discrepancy between belief. 
A great deal of this thesis can be viewed as further evidence of this.

We conclude this section by drawing a connection with the previous one.

The main body of this chapter has focused on material that is directly in the critical path to understanding every important result in this dissertation. 
 % 
 % the state of the field and building up a formal mathematical foundation on which the rest of the dissertation s.
%
At the other extreme, there is also some mathematical background needed only to understand a single chapter; that material is presented before it is needed. 
%
Here, we review some standard mathematical concepts that lie somewhere in between: these concepts play more minor roles than the ones already covered, and are common to a handful of chapters. 
%
%
We encourage a reader to quickly skim this section,
    and return to it if necessary. 


\subsection{Algebra}
\cref{chap:conf,chap:PDG-cat}

\begin{defn}[Monoid]%
    A \emph{monoid} is a tuple $(S, *, e)$, where $S$ is a set, $* : S \times S \to S$ is a binary operation, and $e \in S$ is a distinguished identity element, such that:
    \begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,topsep=0pt,]
        \item (associativity) $\forall a, b,c \in S.~~(a*b)*c = a*(b*c)$;
        \item (identity) $\forall a \in S.~~a * e = a = e * a$.
    \end{itemize}
    A monoid is called \emph{commutative} if it also satisfies
    \begin{itemize}[nosep]
        \item (commutativity): $\forall a, b \in S.~~ a * b = b * a$,
    \end{itemize}
    and \emph{idempotent} if it satisfies
    \begin{itemize}[nosep]
        \item (idempotence): $\forall a \in S.~~ a + a = a$. 
    \end{itemize}
    An idempotent semiring defines partial order by $a \le b \iff a + b = b$. 
\end{defn}

\subsection{Relations}

Let $\mathcal X = \{ X_1, \ldots, X_n \}$ be variables, traditionally called atributes. 
A \emph{relation} $R(\mathcal A) = R(X_1, \ldots, X_n) \subseteq 
\V(X_1) \times \cdots \times \V(X_n)$, or equivalently, $R : \prod_{i=1}^n \V\!X_i \to \{0,1\}$, is a subset of joint values of attributes. 
The natural number $n$ is called the \emph{arity} of $R$. 


The \emph{natural join} of two relations $R(A,B)$ and $S(B,C)$ combines them in a particularly obvious way: $(a,b,c) \in R \bowtie S$ iff $(a,b) \in R$ and $(b,c) \in S$. 
More generally, we have: 

% \begin{defn}[natural join]
%     \[
\begin{equation}
    R(\mathcal X) \bowtie S(\mathcal Y)
        := 
        \Big\{
            \boldsymbol\omega \in  \V(\mathcal X \cup \mathcal Y)
            ~\Big|~
            \mathcal X(\boldsymbol\omega) \in R \land
            \mathcal Y(\boldsymbol\omega) \in S
        \Big\}
        % \qedhere
%     \]
% \end{defn}
\end{equation}

At one extreme, if $\mathcal X$ and $\mathcal Y$ are disjoint sets of attributes, then $R(\mathcal X) \bowtie S(\mathcal Y)$ coincides with the cartesian product of $R \subseteq \V \mathcal X$ and $S \subseteq \V\mathcal Y$.
At the opposite extreme, if $\mathcal X = \mathcal Y$ are the same set of variables, then $R(\mathcal X) \bowtie S(\mathcal X)$ coincides with the intersection of the subsets $R$ and $S$. 

Even when $A_1, \ldots, A_n \subseteq \X$ are not disjoint, we give a convenient extended syntax by defining the quantity $R(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$, where $a_i \in \V(A_i)$. 
Concretely, define $R(a_1,\ldots, a_n) := 0$ if when $\{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}$ do not agree on the value of some shared attribute (i.e., if $\exists X \in \X, \exists i,j \in [n]. ~X \in A_i \cap A_j \land X(a_i) \ne X(a_j)$).
When $\{a,b,c\}$ do agree on all values of shared attributes, let $\mat x$ denote the joint value of $A \cup B \cup C$ obtained from $(a,b,c)$ by removing redundant copies of variable values.
In this case, define $R(a,b,c) := R(\mat x)$.
