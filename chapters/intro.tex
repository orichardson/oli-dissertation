\subsection{Equivalent Representations}

% Suppose I learn that 
When working with abstract tools for modeling and representation, often it is the case that one way of representing things (representation $R_1$) appears to be clearly more general than another (representation $R_2$).
To prove this, you show that anything with representation $R_2$ can be converted to $R_1$.
You convince yourself that the relationship is strict, because very little of $R_1$ is in the image of this transformation---and besides, how could you possibly represent a generic element of $R_1$ with $R_2$? 
But later, you discover that there is in fact a much more subtle way of capturing $R_1$ with $R_2$. 


% Another example is that (fully) randomized PSEMs are equivalent to ordinary PSEMs (\cref{sec:causal}).

Probabililistic Dependency Graphs (PDGs), the central mathematical tool used in this dissertation, are

\subsection{Not Nouns, but Verbs}

I grew up programming in Java. I loved the \href{https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html}{kingdom of nouns}.

When I started to learn about the foundations of mathematics, 
I loved 

AI courses where about nouns.

\subsection{Mathematical Precision for Informal Reasoning}
People---and I am certainly no exception---are often fast and loose with their notation and their math, especially when talking about complicated topics with deep foundations. 

    
This is a sign that the formalism could be improved.
The whole point of formalism is to support reasoning and thought, 
    in a way that aids precision; if it is too cumbersome to use properly,
    perhaps we would be better off with another formalism.
