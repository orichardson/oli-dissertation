\subsection{Equivalent Representations}

% Suppose I learn that 
When working with abstract representations, often it is the case that one class of models (representation $R_1$) seems clearly more general than another (representation $R_2$).
To prove this, you show that anything with representation $R_2$ can be converted to $R_1$; perhaps $R_2$ is even literally a subset of $R_1$. 
You convince yourself that the relationship is strict, because very little of $R_1$ is in the image of this transformation---and besides, how could you possibly represent a generic element of $R_1$ with $R_2$? 
But later, you discover that there is in fact a much more subtle way of capturing $R_1$ with $R_2$. 
Thus $R_1$ turns out to be equivalent to $R_2$. 

To illustrate, consider an example that will soon appear in the mathematical preliminaries (\cref{chap:prelim}). 
Bipartite graphs are clearly a very special class of graphs, with special properties; not every graph is bipartite. 
Also, hypergraphs clearly are generalization of graphs; only the special case where hyperedges have two vertices correspond meaningfully to graphs. 
So, chaning these together, one might reasonably assume that bipartite graphs are an \emph{extremely} special case of hypergraphs---yet they are naturally isomorphic. 
% This pattern will be a recurring theme in this dissertation.

%
% Another example is that (fully) randomized PSEMs are equivalent to ordinary PSEMs (\cref{sec:causal}).
Probabililistic Dependency Graphs (PDGs), the central mathematical object whose theory that we develop in this dissertation, are a particularly special representation in this regard. 
Not only can PDGs capture a great many things (\cref{chap:pdg-repr}), but there is no obvious way to generalize them that is not equivalent. 
There are numerous ways to define PDGs, an numerous seeming generalizations of them, all of which are equivalent. 
% This makes the representation

\subsection{A Division between Quantitative and Qualitative}

% on two levels: a high-level structure
There is an important conceptual division between concepts at two levels,
which goes by different names in different circles. 
% Here, we will largely call the distinction one between \emph{qualitative } 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
    Qualitative & Quantitative \\ 
    Structural & Observational \\
    Values & Types \\ 
    Theorems & Proofs \\
    Definitions & Examples \\
    Schemas & Instances 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The name of a variable, and the names of the variables on which it can depend are qualitative information; the set of values it can take, and its marginal distribution are quantitative information. 

Practically, one benefit of separating these modeling choices is that it allows us to  [[ divide among experts / reason using structure /  ]]

One of the biggest benefits of this separation is that it 

For expressive enough langauges, the lines become blurred. 
Dependent types require one to think about values, leading to can get runtime errors at compile time. 
PDGs, too, blur this line.  We will see that it is possible to define variables that correspond to specific values of a variable (\cref{?})

AI courses where about nouns.

\subsection{Mathematical Precision for Informal Reasoning}
People---and I am certainly no exception---are often fast and loose with their notation and their math, especially when talking about complicated topics with deep foundations. 

    
This is a sign that the formalism could be improved.
The whole point of formalism is to support reasoning and thought, 
    in a way that aids precision; if it is too cumbersome to use properly,
    perhaps we would be better off with another formalism.
