\section{Sewing Things Back Together, with Self-Consistency}

So far we have been working with the degree of inconsistency of a PDG, a number typically in $[0,\infty]$. 
In \cref{chap:conf}, we saw that the confidence domain 
% $[0,\infty]$ 
$[-\infty, 0]$ is isomorphic to $[0,1]$. 

Define the self-consistency of a PDG to be
\[
    \Xi(\dg M) := \mathfrak\exp( - \aar{\dg M}_\gamma). 
\]

Note that $\Xi(\dg M)$
% \begin{prop}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $E$ is an event, then $\Xi(E) = {\singlespacing\begin{cases}
        0 & \text{ if } E = \emptyset \\
        1 & \text{ if } E \ne \emptyset
    \end{cases}}$

    \item If $\mu$ is a probability distribution, and $U$ is an event, 
        then $\Xi(\mu + U) = \mu(U)$.
    
    \item If $\Plaus$ is a Dempster-Shafer probability measure, and $U$ is an event, then $\Xi(\Plaus + U) = \Plaus(U)$. 

    \item If $\dg M$ represents a deterministic classifier and gold standard labels $\Xi(\dg M)$ is the accuracy of the classifier.
    
\end{enumerate}
% \end{prop}
