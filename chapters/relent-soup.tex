Based on the results of \url{https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~oli/files/papers/lafi.pdf};
will show that PDGs also arise from using relative entropy as the loss function in the previous chapter, in the update setting where $\Theta = \Delta \V\!\X$.

% Consider the update setting in which $\Theta = \Delta \V\!\X$.
