		  in any sense, even for a single evidence node E, is

		  allowed to contain extreme conditional probabilities—that
		  is, conditional probabilities arbitrarily close to 0.
		  Nevertheless, all previous approximation algorithms have
		  failed to approximate efficiently many inferences, even for
		  belief networks without extreme conditional probabilities.
		  We prove that we can approximate efficiently probabilistic
		  inference in belief networks without extreme conditional
		  probabilities. We construct a randomized approximation
		  algorithm—the bounded-variance algorithm—that is a
		  variant of the known likelihood-weighting algorithm. The
		  bounded-variance algorithm is the first algorithm with
		  provably fast inference approximation on all belief
		  networks without extreme conditional probabilities. From
		  the bounded-variance algorithm, we construct a
		  deterministic approximation algorithm using current
		  advances in the theory of pseudorandom generators. In
		  contrast to the exponential worst-case behavior of all
		  previous deterministic approximations, the deterministic
		  bounded-variance algorithm approximates inference
		  probabilities in worst-case time that is subexponential
		  2(log n) d, for some integer d that is a linear function of
		  the depth of the belief network.}

		  characterizes all independence assertions that logically
		  follow from the topology of a network and develops a linear
		  time algorithm that identifies these assertions. The
		  algorithm's correctness is based on the soundness of a
		  graphical criterion, called d-separation, and its
		  optimality stems from the completeness of d-separation. An
		  enhanced version of d-separation, called D-separation, is
		  defined, extending the algorithm to networks that encode
		  functional dependencies. Finally, the algorithm is shown to
		  work for a broad class of nonprobabilistic
		  independencies.},

		  graphs without positivity assumptions on the densities
		  involved. A criterion for conditional independence of two
		  groups of variables given a third is given and named as the
		  directed, global Markov property. We give a simple proof of
		  the fact that the directed, local Markov property and
		  directed, global Markov property are equivalent and – in
		  the case of absolute continuity w. r. t. a product measure
		  – equivalent to the recursive factorization of densities.
		  It is argued that our criterion is easy to use, it is
		  sharper than that given by Kiiveri, Speed, and Carlin and
		  equivalent to that of Pearl. It follows that our criterion
		  cannot be sharpened.},

		  understanding a complex system’s organization. We
		  recently showed that the transfer entropy fails in a key
		  aspect of this—measuring information flow—due to its
		  conflation of dyadic and polyadic relationships. We extend
		  this observation to demonstrate that Shannon information
		  measures (entropy and mutual information, in their
		  conditional and multivariate forms) can fail to accurately
		  ascertain multivariate dependencies due to their conflation
		  of qualitatively different relations among variables. This
		  has broad implications, particularly when employing
		  information to express the organization and mechanisms
		  embedded in complex systems, including the burgeoning
		  efforts to combine complex network theory with information
		  theory. Here, we do not suggest that any aspect of
		  information theory is wrong. Rather, the vast majority of
		  its informational measures are simply inadequate for
		  determining the meaningful relationships among variables
		  within joint probability distributions. We close by
		  demonstrating that such distributions exist across an
		  arbitrary set of variables.},

		  the probability that a propositional expression is true. In
		  this paper we show that this problem is computationally
		  intractable even in surprisingly restricted cases and even
		  if we settle for an approximation to this probability. We
		  consider various methods used in approximate reasoning such
		  as computing degree of belief and Bayesian belief networks,
		  as well as reasoning techniques such as constraint
		  satisfaction and knowledge compilation, that use
		  approximation to avoid computational difficulties, and
		  reduce them to model-counting problems over a propositional
		  domain. We prove that counting satisfying assignments of
		  propositional languages is intractable even for Horn and
		  monotone formulae, and even when the size of clauses and
		  number of occurrences of the variables are extremely
		  limited. This should be contrasted with the case of
		  deductive reasoning, where Horn theories and theories with
		  binary clauses are distinguished by the existence of linear
		  time satisfiability algorithms. What is even more
		  surprising is that, as we show, even approximating the
		  number of satisfying assignments (i.e., “approximating”
		  approximate reasoning), is intractable for most of these
		  restricted theories. We also identify some restricted
		  classes of propositional formulae for which efficient
		  algorithms for counting satisfying assignments can be
		  given.}
