abstract="We present a unifying framework for generating extended formulations for the polyhedral outer approximations used in algorithms for mixed-integer convex programming (MICP). Extended formulations lead to fewer iterations of outer approximation algorithms and generally faster solution times. First, we observe that all MICP instances from the MINLPLIB2 benchmark library are conic representable with standard symmetric and nonsymmetric cones. Conic reformulations are shown to be effective extended formulations themselves because they encode separability structure. For mixed-integer conic-representable problems, we provide the first outer approximation algorithm with finite-time convergence guarantees, opening a path for the use of conic solvers for continuous relaxations. We then connect the popular modeling framework of disciplined convex programming (DCP) to the existence of extended formulations independent of conic representability. We present evidence that our approach can yield significant gains in practice, with the solution of a number of open instances from the MINLPLIB2 benchmark library.",

abstract = {Approximating the inference probability Pr[X = x | E = e] in any sense, even for a single evidence node E, is NP-hard. This result holds for belief networks that are allowed to contain extreme conditional probabilities—that is, conditional probabilities arbitrarily close to 0. Nevertheless, all previous approximation algorithms have failed to approximate efficiently many inferences, even for belief networks without extreme conditional probabilities. We prove that we can approximate efficiently probabilistic inference in belief networks without extreme conditional probabilities. We construct a randomized approximation algorithm—the bounded-variance algorithm—that is a variant of the known likelihood-weighting algorithm. The bounded-variance algorithm is the first algorithm with provably fast inference approximation on all belief networks without extreme conditional probabilities. From the bounded-variance algorithm, we construct a deterministic approximation algorithm using current advances in the theory of pseudorandom generators. In contrast to the exponential worst-case behavior of all previous deterministic approximations, the deterministic bounded-variance algorithm approximates inference probabilities in worst-case time that is subexponential 2(log n) d, for some integer d that is a linear function of the depth of the belief network.}

abstract = {Many AI problems, when formalized, reduce to evaluating the probability that a propositional expression is true. In this paper we show that this problem is computationally intractable even in surprisingly restricted cases and even if we settle for an approximation to this probability. We consider various methods used in approximate reasoning such as computing degree of belief and Bayesian belief networks, as well as reasoning techniques such as constraint satisfaction and knowledge compilation, that use approximation to avoid computational difficulties, and reduce them to model-counting problems over a propositional domain. We prove that counting satisfying assignments of propositional languages is intractable even for Horn and monotone formulae, and even when the size of clauses and number of occurrences of the variables are extremely limited. This should be contrasted with the case of deductive reasoning, where Horn theories and theories with binary clauses are distinguished by the existence of linear time satisfiability algorithms. What is even more surprising is that, as we show, even approximating the number of satisfying assignments (i.e., “approximating” approximate reasoning), is intractable for most of these restricted theories. We also identify some restricted classes of propositional formulae for which efficient algorithms for counting satisfying assignments can be given.}
