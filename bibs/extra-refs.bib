abstract="Inconsistency arises in many areas in advanced computing. Examples include: Merging information from heterogeneous sources; Negotiation in multi-agent systems; Understanding natural language dialogues; and Commonsense reasoning in robotics. Often inconsistency is unwanted, for example, in the specification for a plan, or in sensor fusion in robotics. But sometimes inconsistency is useful, e.g. when lawyers look for inconsistencies in an opposition case, or in a brainstorming session in research collaboration. Whether inconsistency is unwanted or useful, there is a need to develop tolerance to inconsistency in application technologies such as databases, knowledgebases, and software systems. To address this, inconsistency tolerance is being built on foundational technologies for identifying and analysing inconsistency in information, for representing and reasoning with inconsistent information, for resolving inconsistent information, and for merging inconsistent information. In this introductory chapter, we consider the need and role for inconsistency tolerance, and briefly review some of the foundational technologies for inconsistency tolerance.",

abstract = {Friedman and Shimony exhibited an anomaly in Jaynes' maximum entropy prescription: that if a certain unknown parameter is assumed to be characterized a priori by a normalizable probability measure, then the prior and posterior probabilities computed by means of the prescription are consistent with probability theory only if this measure assigns probability 1 to a single value of the parameter and probability 0 to the entire range of other values. We strengthen this result by deriving the same conclusion using only the assumption that the probability measure is σ-finite. We also show that when the hypothesis and evidence to which the prescription is applied are expressed in certain rather simple languages, then the maximum entropy prescription yields probability evaluation in agreement with one of Carnap's λ-continuum of inductive methods, namely λ = ∞. We conclude that the maximum entropy prescription is correct only under special circumstances, which are essentially those in which it is appropriate to use λ = ∞.}

Here, we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both flexibility and tractability. The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model. We additionally release an open source reference implementation of the algorithm.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
The theory of types is intended to be a full-scale system for formalizing intuitionistic mathematics as developed. The language of the theory is richer than the languages of traditional intuitionistic systems in permitting proofs to appear as parts of propositions so that the propositions of the theory can express properties of proofs. There are axioms for universes that link the generation of objects and types and play somewhat the same role for the present theory as does the replacement axiom for Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. The present theory is based on a strongly impredicative axiom that there is a type of all types in symbols. This axiom has to be abandoned, however, after it has been shown to lead to a contraction. This chapter discusses Normalization theorem, which can be strengthened in two ways: it can be made to cover open terms and it can be proved that every reduction sequence starting from an arbitrary term leads to a unique normal term after a finite number of steps. The definition of the notion of convertibility and the proof that an arbitrary term is convertible can no longer be separated because the type symbols and the terms are generated simultaneously.}

 abstract = {This is the classic work upon which modern-day game theory is based. What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press publishedTheory of Games and Economic Behavior. In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory--has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences.This sixtieth anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original publication in the New York Times, ttheAmerican Economic Review, and a variety of other publications. Together, these writings provide readers a matchless opportunity to more fully appreciate a work whose influence will yet resound for generations to come.},
